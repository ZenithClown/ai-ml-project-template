<div align = "justify">

Utilities directory is generally a (in my opinion) a non-project related custom functions developed to help in code functioning.
Typically, the directory can be shared across project and should provide general functions that *fits all* for which the function
was designed for. The subdirectory [**`utilities/submodules`**](./submodules/) is designed to keep submodule libraries that
either [**`I`**](https://zenithclown.github.io/) have created or sourced from different open-source repositories. The actual
submodules can either be added using [`git submodule`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-submodule) or can be added to `PYTHONPATH`.
