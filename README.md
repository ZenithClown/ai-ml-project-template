**Objective:** A *simple* and *well-designed* template structure to start a machine learning/deep learning-based project. The template provides a basic directory structure with additional files (like [`examples/BOILERPLATE.ipynb`](./examples/BOILERPLATE.ipynb) to perform EDA. In addition, the template is designed such that code can be deployed into production. *Quickly get started* working on the code, and preparing documentation as highlighted below. To understand the template check [**HOWTO.md**](./HOWTO.md) file.

AI-ML :brain: is an extremely fast-growing environment where millions of new commits :eye: and thousands of users :man: :woman: are actively engaging on a daily basis :calendar:. To start a new project :package:, one should generally set up a basic project structure with some default branches and files. <a href = "https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-template-repository">GitHub Templates</a> solves this by setting up a template from an existing repositories. The template :receipt: provides a minimalistic approach to quickly start a machine learning/artificial intelligence project. :gear:

For more information :bulb: on how to use this template and get started, check <a href = "HOWTO.md">HOWTO</a>. Feel free to use the template as it suits you! :rocket:
It would be great if you :link: put a link to my template, if you use this repository!

## :writing_hand: Project Name

:writing_hand: Please add/modify the project details on your first project start, as <a href = "https://www.atlassian.com/work-management/knowledge-sharing/documentation/importance-of-documentation">documentation is important</a> and let end user have proper knowledge! :dart: Start by editing all the sections/paragraphs marked with ":writing_hand:".

> Client Name: :writing_hand: `client name` (`client details/information`) :office:

### Explorative Results

:writing_hand: The template can also be used in creating research papers :book:, white paper :memo:, summary reports:scroll:, production-level codes :trophy:, etc. Necessary explorative results :tada: can be documented in this section.

> Report Link: :writing_hand: `report link` :closed_book:

### Modelling Results

:writing_hand: Information about the used models/engines/agents and their performance can be documented here :sparkles:. An AI/ML-trained model can be stored in their respective directories.

> Report Link: :writing_hand: `report link` :ledger:

### Configurations

:writing_hand: A <a href = "config"><code>config</code></a> directory is available to store and configure projects with variables, values, and/or other pieces of information related to the project template.

### Project Deployment and Planning

:bookmark: Relevant information related to project deployment, planning, production-ready code. For more information :interrobang: on individual version check <a href = "CHANGELOG.md">CHANGELOG</a>. :heavy_check_mark:

## LICENSE & Contributions

:label: A <a href = "CONTRIBUTING.md">CONTRIBUTING.md</a> file, in your open-source repository or site, provides potential project contributors with a short guide to how they can help with your project or study group. It is a convention to capitalize the word "contributing" as the file title, and to save it as a resource in markdown (hence the extension .md) (<a href = "https://mozillascience.github.io/working-open-workshop/contributing/">source</a>). :writing_hand: For <b>LICENSE</b> create or add your own file as <code>LICENSE</code>.

## Resources

:card_index: Documentation and/or Resources for your codes, and other mentions can be included in this section! :key:
