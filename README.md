**Objective:** A *simple* and *well-designed* template structure to start a machine learning/deep learning-based project. The
template provides a basic directory structure with additional files (like [`examples/BOILERPLATE.ipynb`](./examples/BOILERPLATE.ipynb))
to perform EDA. In addition, the template is designed such that code can be deployed into production. *Quickly get started*
working on the code, and preparing documentation as highlighted below. To understand the template check [**HOWTO.md**](./HOWTO.md) file.

AI-ML 🧠 is an extremely fast-growing environment where millions of new commits 👁️ and thousands of users 👨👩 are actively
engaging on a daily basis 📆. To start a new project 📦, one should generally set up a basic project structure with some default
branches and files.
[GitHub Templates](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-template-repository) solves
this by setting up a template from an existing repositories. The template :receipt: provides a minimalistic approach to quickly
start a machine learning/artificial intelligence project.

For more information 💡 on how to use this template and get started, check [HOWTO](./HOWTO.md). Feel free to use the template
as it suits you! 🚀 It would be great if you 🔗 put a link to my template, if you use this repository!

## ✍ Project Name

✍ Please add/modify the project details on your first project start, as
[documentation is important](https://www.atlassian.com/work-management/knowledge-sharing/documentation/importance-of-documentation)
and let end user have proper knowledge! :dart: Start by editing all the sections/paragraphs marked with "✍".

> Client Name: ✍ `client name` (`client details/information`) 🏢

### Explorative Results

✍ The template can also be used in creating research papers :book:, white paper :memo:, summary reports 📜,
production-level codes 🏆, etc. Necessary explorative results :tada: can be documented in this section.

> Report Link: ✍ `report link` 📕

### Modelling Results

✍ Information about the used models/engines/agents and their performance can be documented here ✨. An
AI/ML-trained model can be stored in their respective directories.

> Report Link: ✍ `report link` 📒

### Configurations

✍ A ⚙️ [`config`](./config/) directory is available to store and configure projects with variables, values, and/or
other pieces of information related to the project template.

### Project Deployment and Planning

🔖 Relevant information related to project deployment, planning, production-ready code. For more information
⁉️ on individual version check ✔️ [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md).

## LICENSE & Contributions

🏷️ A `CONTRIBUTING.md` file, in your open-source repository or site, provides potential project contributors with a short guide
to how they can help with your project or study group. It is a convention to capitalize the word "contributing" as the file
title, and to save it as a resource in markdown (hence the extension .md)
([source](https://mozillascience.github.io/working-open-workshop/contributing/)).

✍ The code adheres to the open-source [MIT License](./LICENSE) but any project may use alternate license as per project
requirement - change and/or adjust the file.

✍ The code repository comes with [CODEOWNERS](./.github/CODEOWNERS), like the license file end users are requested to change
the file content with the username and/or organization name.

## Resources

📇🔑 Documentation and/or Resources for your codes, and other mentions can be included in this section! In this section, I'm
trying to provide some external resources which can be helpful for your awesome project.

### Awesome Projects

✍ A list of awesome open-source projects that depends/developed from this template.
