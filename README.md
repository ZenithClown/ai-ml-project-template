<p align = "justify">AI-ML is an extremely fast growing environment where millions of new commits and thousands of users are actively engaging on a daily basis. To start a new project, one should generally setup a basic project structure with some default branches and files. <a href = "https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-template-repository">GitHub Templates</a> solves this by setting up a template from an existing repositories. The template provides minimalistic approach to quickly start a machine learning/artificial intelligence project. :gear:</p>
