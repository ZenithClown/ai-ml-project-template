<h1 align = "center">Information about <code>src</code> Directory</h1>

<div align = "justify">

A "_heart_" of any project is the `src` which contains the "source" files for the project. As a *production level* code template, the directory provides three important directories as follows (I) `agents` : typically contains agent definations for a RNN application; (II) `engine` : provides a suit of machine learning analytic functions to perform model training and analytics on your dataset without giving up end-to-end performance; and (III) `models` : typically contains model definations.
